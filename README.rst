A python wrapper around the Particle Cloud API (http://particle.io)

Installable directly via pip. However some systems might need to install requests[security] if they get the InsecurePlatformWarning. That hasn't been included in the requirements by default because it may not be required on all platforms.

Tests

Tests coming soon. Except tests for this particular package are going to be highly localized. You will need to provide a valid, particle username, password and not to mention a proper device ID that can be used to test the claim and request features
